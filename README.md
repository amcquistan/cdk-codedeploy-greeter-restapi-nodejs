# Reference Project: AWS CDK and CodeBuild for NodeJS Greeter REST API

This is a learning reference project for using AWS Cloud Development Kit v2 (CDK) in conjunction with AWS CodeDeploy for deploying a NodeJS based Greeter REST API.
 
## Boilerplate from CDK Init

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

#### Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
